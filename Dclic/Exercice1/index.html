<p>My name is Andy AUGUSTIN, and I am from Verrettes, Haiti. I am a civil engineer, graduating as the top student of my class from G.O.C. University. My passion for the construction field led me to want to deepen my knowledge, particularly in structural engineering and construction project management</p>
<p>Throughout my academic journey, I acquired solid skills in structural studies and project management through various activities, research, and projects I worked on as part of my Bachelor's degree. These include the design and study of a 5-story reinforced concrete commercial building for a modern public market in PV, as well as the design of a 5-story reinforced concrete residential complex, among others. My education allowed me to develop technical skills in the use of design and analysis software, preparing me to tackle complex issues related to the design, studies, planning, and execution of construction projects.</p>
<p>In parallel with my studies, I had the opportunity to work as a mentor and program coordinator for a mentorship project. This experience helped me strengthen my skills in project writing, report preparation, and follow-up organization, particularly in a humanitarian context. I also learned how to work in teams and communicate effectively in an intercultural environment.</p>
